# Recursive-Functions
A variety of recursive functions that perform number and string manipulation tasks

## backwards Function: 

Flips the input backwards

## new_line Function:

Takes the inputs and displays it with each digit having its own line

## sum Function:

Sums all numbers from 1 to n, where n is an integer input (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)

## squares Function:

Sums all squares of numbers 1 to n, where n is an integer input (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2)

## divisors Function:

Outputs the largest integer divisor of an inputted integer that isn't itself (15 yields 5)

## palindrome Function:

Checks if an inputted string is a palindrome 

## string_converter Function:

Converts an inputted integer into a string with the same digits (int: 1234 -> string: "1234")

## binary Function:

Converts a decimal input to a binary value
